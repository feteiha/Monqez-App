# Monqez-App

First aid is vital for saving lives and averting the victim’s condition from deteriorating. That’s why the world could use a fast and easy method of communication connecting people with paramedics when emergencies occur. Some websites and applications exist that offer such functionality but unfortunately, they have their limitations. So, we propose developing an application, “Monqez”, that aims to help people in need of first aid and connect users requesting help to the nearest available paramedics. Several tools and techniques such as video conferencing and location tracking will be used to build this application and enable its functionalities. In this document, we will discuss the features, tools, design, and implementation aspects of Monqez as well as our concluding remarks.
